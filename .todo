### General
Create 'alias' property to alias ids in data lookups.
    Check for colliding ids / aliases

### Filemanager
Sort folders before files (list view)
Forwards backwards buttons disabled color isn't very visible
History has duplicate entries

toolbar button items are flaky at best
add "copy link" for logged in users..?

Scale icons down with config
Cleanup and unify file selection logic



clicking text fucks up ctrl click and shift click
sorting in grid mode does nothing?
